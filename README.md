Project 3 with DigitalSkola
DigitalSkola is an education platform that provides online course Bootcamp for anyone who wants to learn something new and upgrade their skill, mainly in the digital world.

One of the Bootcamp courses in Digital Skola is Data Engineer, which I joined now.

In this session, the students learn about Batch Processing. 


Batch processing is a method that computers use to solve repetitive data tasks with high volume periodically. Specific data processing tasks, such as backup, filtering, and sorting, can be computationally intensive and inefficient to run on individual transaction data. In contrast, data systems process such tasks in batches, often not busy when computing resources are more commonly available, such as at the end of the day or overnight.

As I am still a beginner in this coding area, I would like some insight to make a better report that can be useful to anyone who reads. Happy reading!
